## Story of Hate Crimes- A Decade-wise analysis of hate crimes in the US

The purpose of our project is to look at how Hate Crimes in the USA have an association with various factors.
We came up with topic as the social issue about Hate Crimes is more relevant now, than ever, and the Hypotheses here help us understand how Hate Crimes have changed over the two decades.

We came up with 2 Major Hypothesis, and upon discussion with our Professor, we decided to include a 3rd and a 4th Hypothesis as well to better capture the data.

### Hypothesis 1:
The comparison of hate crime victims' count over a time-series of the past 2 decades:
The rate of hate crimes was higher between 2000-2010 vs between 2010-2019

### Conclusion for Hypothesis 1:
From the below graph, we can see that we fail to reject our Hypothesis 1. There is infact a dip in the crime rates in the decade of 2010-2019

### Hypothesis 2:
There is a correlation between States with different race population and hate crimes victims, the races being- White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander as well as Multiple Races

### Conclusion for Hypothesis 2:
From the below graph as an example of one of the Races that we analyze here, we can see that we fail to reject our Hypothesis 2.

### Hypothesis 3:
Testing association between unemployment rate and hate crime based on the correaltion value.
![Unemployment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77983281/116894968-4868d100-abf8-11eb-98fc-ba856b2c8100.jpg)

### Conclusion for Hypothesis 3:
As we can see from the below graph as one example of a State, there is no strong pattern that can be deduced here for determining whether there is an association between Unemployment Rate and Victim Counts. Hence, here we Reject our Hypothesis.

### Hypothesis 4:
Since 1991, Anti-white hate crimes have increased, while crimes against other races (Black, Asian, Multiple) have decreased.
![Bias](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77983353/117680118-7e690080-b176-11eb-9331-eec8ad8a258a.jpg)


### Conclusion for Hypothesis 4:
As we can see from the Stacked Bar Plot, the hate crimes towards races mostly remain unchanged. Hence, we Reject our Hypothesis.

### Conclusion:
From all our above Hypothesis, we aim to understand how Hate Crimes have changed over the decades, and whether the Racial Population plays a part in the Victim Count of Hate Crimes being committed over the years, along with an Unemployment and a Bias factor that is analysed against the Data.
